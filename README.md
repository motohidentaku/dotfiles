# dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/motohidentaku/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles/etc
./install.sh
```
or

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/motohidentaku/dotfiles/master/etc/install.sh)"
```
